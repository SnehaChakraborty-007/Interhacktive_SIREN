🚨 SIREN – A Women Safety & Social Impact Website

🌟 Inspiration

This project falls under the theme of Social Impact, aiming to contribute meaningful help to people—especially women—who may find themselves in dangerous situations. The motivation behind SIREN comes from real-life incidents that many of us have either experienced or heard about.

A few months ago, one of our team members came across an incident involving someone she knew. The person was returning home late at night and sensed that a group of four men were following her. She felt threatened and tried calling the emergency helpline, but the call went unanswered. Situations like these are unfortunately common. Many emergency or SOS calls are either delayed or not picked up at all, leaving victims helpless at crucial moments.

This incident inspired us to create SIREN—a website that provides an alternative, quick, and accessible way to alert others and seek immediate help when danger is sensed.

🔍 Overview

SIREN literally means “a warning sound”, which perfectly aligns with the purpose of this project. The website is designed to help individuals who sense danger—such as being stalked, followed, witnessing a kidnapping, or facing domestic violence.

The core feature of the website is a large red SIREN button. When a person in distress clicks this button:

A siren sound is triggered to draw attention.

The user can submit a distress message.

The message is securely stored in a cloud database.

The message history can be viewed on a separate page.

This system acts as a substitute for emergency calls, offering an additional layer of safety when traditional systems fail or are unavailable.

⚠️ Social Challenges Addressed

The website focuses on addressing real-world safety challenges, including but not limited to:

Women’s safety: Despite laws and activism, women remain extremely vulnerable to physical, psychological, and economic violence.

Walking alone at night: Many people feel unsafe walking alone due to frequent cases of stalking and harassment.

Ragging and hazing: Still prevalent in educational institutions despite being illegal.

Kidnapping and abduction: People often hesitate to intervene due to fear.

Domestic violence, robbery, and human trafficking.

Violence against women is a violation of dignity and human rights, affecting victims throughout their lives. This project aims to contribute a small but meaningful step toward addressing these issues.

🛠️ Technical Challenges Faced

While developing the website, we encountered several challenges:

Making the website responsive using CSS and media queries required significant effort and learning.

Implementing audio playback (siren sound) using JavaScript was challenging, especially ensuring it could toggle on and off correctly.

Understanding and integrating Firebase Realtime Database for storing and retrieving data was a new and valuable learning experience.

🚀 Recent Implementations (New Features)

We have successfully enhanced the project with the following features:

Firebase Realtime Database Integration

Distress messages submitted by users are now stored permanently in the database.

Message History

All previously submitted messages are displayed on the Distressed Messages page.

Timestamp Logging

Each message is stored along with the exact date and time of submission.

Location Capture

The user’s location is recorded in the form of latitude and longitude, providing crucial context during emergencies.

Real-time Updates

Messages appear instantly on the messages page without needing a page refresh.

These features significantly improve the usefulness and reliability of the platform.

🔮 Future Plans

We are currently second-year students, and this is our first hackathon project. SIREN is just an initial prototype of a much larger idea. In the future, we plan to implement:

Camera Access

When the siren button is pressed, the device camera will activate automatically to record the incident and possibly capture the aggressor.

Live Location Tracking

The user’s live location will be shared in real time with emergency responders and nearby authorities for faster rescue.

These features would greatly enhance the effectiveness of the platform in real-world emergency scenarios.

❤️ Final Note

SIREN is a small step toward building a safer society. While it is a beginner-level project, it represents a strong intention to use technology for social good. With further development and support, this idea has the potential to evolve into a powerful safety tool.
