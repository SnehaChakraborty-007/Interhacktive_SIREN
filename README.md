 **Overview**:

This project falls under the theme of “Social Impact" which aims in contributing some help to the people especially women in danger . The name of this project is SIREN, which literally means 'a warning sound' which quite well fits with the motive of this project. If someone senses danger around them (like they are being stalked or followed, watching someone get kidnapped or a victim of domestic violence) wherever they might be, they could just visit this website and press on the large red coloured SIREN button, so that the we get notified about it and can inform the police or the emergency team to get ready with immediate help. This website could be a substitute way to the the emergency or SOS call which is often not picked up and is of no proper use.

**Challenges we face** :

The purpose of this website is to provide immediate help to those people (irrespective of their gender) who have sensed danger or suspicion around them. But despite global pacts, new laws and gender activism, women remain extremely vulnerable to violence. Violence against women is an indicator of how prone societies are towards violence. Women’s safety isn’t only threatened or violated during wars and conflicts. It’s threatened in their daily lives in both public and private spheres, including in stable democracies and during times of peace .Women also experience economic and psychological forms of violence. Gender-based violence is a violation of women’s dignity and rights. It affects their human security and remains with them throughout their lives.

Walking alone in the empty streets at night, is still a nightmare for many of us, as there are a lot of terrible cases that has occurred in this plot, i.e, someone being stalked or followed.
-Ragging, or hazing, is a common problem in educational institutions. Despite being banned by the government the practice continues to persist, leading to a growing number of incidents of physical and psychological abuse.

Kidnapping and Abduction is also very common nowadays. People are often afraid to physically take a step ahead when the get to see someone being kidnapped or abducted. This website could be of great help then.
There are a lot more cases like robbery, domestic violence, human trafficking, etc.

**Future plans** :

We are currently in second year and this is the very first hackathon event we are participating in. Hence, we can call ourselves beginners, getting to know some of the programming languages. This project is a very small and rough idea of a bigger project that could be made. We have thought of implementing two more options that would boost the working of this website.

Camera settings:
As soon as a person clicks on the siren button, the device camera would start working, and hence there's a great chance that the aggressor would get recorded as well as the whole incident. 2) Location tracker : Another important feature we have thought of, is tracking the victim's location as soon as they press the siren button. The location of the device would be turned on (if it wasn't ) and would be sent to us, which we can share to the police and the emergency team for the rescue.
